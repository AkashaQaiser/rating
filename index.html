                                These guys are not only the best watch dealers in Miami but the world. Their selection is incredible, their customer service is by far the best, the the overall experience they provide is untouchable.

                                Bought a watch from them through IG advertised as “brand new with box and papers” watch came with light scratches and missing the stickers. Obviously a used watch, only issue is it was advertised like new. Now when I try to reach out I don’t get a response back anywhere. <br>
                                Called the number and someone answered the first time and told me to text him pictures. I texted him pictures and got ghosted. Would love to have this handled and I’ll change my review, but for now it’s 2 stars due to watch received not being what was promised. <br>
                                Edit: got in contact and they were able to get things handled

                                The best in the business! Timepiece Trading has tons of luxury timepieces in stock at all times and has helped me source multiple watches. The team is amazing, very responsive, and incredibly trustworthy.

                                Out of all the watch dealers worldwide, I have to say TPT is by far the best. With amazing customer care and stock that can put any dealer to shame they are the people to go to if in search of a watch. There isn’t a watch you could want that Timepiece Trading won’t have or can’t get you!
